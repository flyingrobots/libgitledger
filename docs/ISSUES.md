# Issues Index

The canonical source of truth for planning is GitHub Issues + the Project board.

- Project v2: https://github.com/users/flyingrobots/projects/6
- Roadmap DAG: docs/ROADMAP-DAG.md (SVG in docs/ROADMAP-DAG.svg)

This file intentionally stays light; see the project board for Status, Priority, Estimate, Risk, and dependencies (blocked by).
